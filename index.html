        <p>The goal of this project was to design a portfolio website that showed off my brand and style in a unique way. Using my knowledge of CSS, HTML and javascript, I was able to deisgn a responsive website that featured updateable grids elements with emphasis on certain projects, and a working contact page.</p>

        <h1>React Copy Cat Project</h1>
        <p>The capstone of Codecademyâ€™s React 101 course was creating this program called Copy Cat. The goal was to code a text input box that would send live updates to a parent class which would then display the exact text you were typing into a different html element. The trick was setting a picture of a cat to be a button that would toggle this feature on and off. All of this was created using React and JSX.</p>

        <h1>Dimension Defenders Site</h1>
        <p>The goal of this project was simply to design a webpage with multiple inline elements. I took the asignment a step further and tried out some CSS elements I had picked up. I designed a website with a sticky nav element with hyperlinks to various parts of the page. In addition, the main page features a parallax background, though currently, it is simply one static image. The site was created using CSS, HTML and JavaScript.</p>
